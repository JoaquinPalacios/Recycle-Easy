        description: 'Polystyrene can be difficult to recycle due to its bulky, yet lightweight nature, and the fact that it’s manufactured from petroleum. You should avoid buying products that have this recycling code on them. However, if you do have products that contain this code, try to reuse the material for another use inside your home, or donate it to a local craft shop so that it doesn’t go into landfill.

This includes batteries in laptops, mobile phones, power tools and cameras. Aldi supermarkets offer a free battery recycling service at all their Australian stores. Any brand of AA, AAA, C, D and 9V batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) are accepted - simply drop your used batteries into the dedicated bins in store. For other services and for options for different battery types (eg buttons and 12 volts) see below. Woolworths supermarkets are rolling out battery and mobile phone collection points in their stores throughout 2021.',
