Under-inflated tyres can increase fuel consumption by three per cent and take 10,000 kilometres off the tyre's life; Service your car regularly. A well-tuned car can use 15 per cent less fuel; Slow down. Driving at 90 kilometres per hour uses 25 per cent less fuel than travelling at 110 kilometres per hour; Don't idle. If you are stopping for more than ten seconds, turn your car off; Drive smoothly. Stopping and starting uses more fuel; Open your window rather than using your air conditioner when travelling at under 70 kilometres per hour. Air conditioning can increase fuel consumption by ten per cent. At speeds above this, the drag caused by having your window down will use more fuel than the air conditioning; Screw on your fuel cap firmly to avoid evaporation and leaks when turning corners; Travel light. Don't use your car to store heavy equipment for long periods of time, an extra 50 kilograms of weight increases fuel consumption by two per cent;Remove roof racks and anything fixed to the outside of your car when they are not in use to minimise wind resistance.",
